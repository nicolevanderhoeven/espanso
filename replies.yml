    replace: |
              I don't offer consulting services, unfortunately. I work full-time and Obsidian is a part-time passion project, so can't really start new projects right now. However, I can recommend two people who *do* offer consulting that I can recommend as good members of the community:
              - Kara Munroe: kara@monarchstrategiesllc.com . She does YouTube videos at https://www.youtube.com/@knowledgeworknexus/videos
              - Bianca Pereira: She does courses and PKM coaching. Email her at: contact@biancapereira.me . She also makes YouTube videos at https://www.youtube.com/@BiaResearcher

              Hi there,

              Thanks for reaching out. However, I don't believe {{product}} is a good fit for my audience at this point, and my ethics statement (https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/ethics/), as well as my limited time, prohibits me from accepting most opportunities. I hope you understand!

              I wish you the best of luck in finding someone who is a better fit.


              Thanks,
              Nicole

              Hi there,

              Thanks for reaching out, but I'm not interested in any services regarding advertising, SEO, marketing, or growth.


              Cheers,
              Nicole

              Hi there,

              I'm not too familiar with {{product}}, and I do have a list of things I usually look for in a PKM tool before I have a look at it, since there are so many these days! I also publish that list here: https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Characteristics+of+a+good+Personal+Knowledge+Management+system#Requirements+for+a+PKM+tool

              Would you mind letting me know which of the following {{product}} checks?
              - [ ] Stores notes locally.
              - [ ] Saves notes in Markdown or another plaintext format.
              - [ ] Allows hypertext linking between notes and to external URLs.
              - [ ] Shows backlinks.
              - [ ] Shows unlinked mentions.
              - [ ] Can be used offline.
              - [ ] Can be used on multiple devices and operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).
              - [ ] Syncs seamlessly across devices.
              - [ ] Allows freeform text (paragraphs, not just bullets).
              - [ ] Has a robust search (tags, path, regular expressions) or querying system (for metadata).
              - [ ] Allows addition of metadata (tags, custom parameters).

              Until a tool ticks all of those boxes, I'm unfortunately unable to spend the time on it to review it. If that's the case, I still wish you luck with it! Maybe someday we can circle back around to it. Thanks for understanding!


              Cheers,
              Nicole
